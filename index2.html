        <section class="data-preprocessing">
            <h2>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>Utilize publicly available datasets, such as Kaggle's COVID-19 Radiography Database, which contains labeled chest X-ray images. Ensure the dataset includes both COVID-positive and healthy samples.</p>

            <h3>Preprocessing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image resizing:</strong> Standardize image sizes to a specific resolution (e.g., 224x224 pixels) for input to the model.</li>
                <li><strong>Image augmentation:</strong> Apply rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip to create diversity and reduce overfitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1] to ensure numerical stability during training.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="model-development">
            <h2>Model Development and Training</h2>
            <h3>Algorithm Selection</h3>
            <p>We will use deep learning algorithms, primarily focusing on CNNs for image classification tasks. Some key architectures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ResNet (Residual Networks):</strong> Known for solving the vanishing gradient problem, making it suitable for deeper networks.</li>
                <li><strong>VGG (Visual Geometry Group Network):</strong> Simple architecture with a strong performance on image classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom CNN:</strong> A lightweight CNN model for faster training and inference on limited datasets or hardware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70/20/10 split).</li>
                <li>Use <strong>cross-entropy loss</strong> for binary classification and optimize with the <strong>Adam optimizer</strong>.</li>
                <li>Monitor the validation loss and accuracy to prevent overfitting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
            <p>Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize performance.</p>

            <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
            <h3>Metrics</h3>
            <p>Assess model performance using key metrics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Proportion of correctly predicted images.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision:</strong> How many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall (Sensitivity):</strong> How well the model identifies positive cases.</li>
                <li><strong>F1-score:</strong> Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced performance evaluation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Visualization</h3>
            <p>Use confusion matrices, ROC curves, and Grad-CAM to visualize model performance and explainability.</p>
